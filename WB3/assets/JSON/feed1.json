Come and experience a truly spiritual performance by renowned Japanese dance group Muyuju in their first-ever United States appearance. Toward a new dance expression, the Odissi dance group Muyuju was formed in 2008 by Mayumi Fukushima and Hitomi Kiriyama who are the Odissi dancers. The Hindustani Classical musicians, Go Arai (violin and sitar) and Shiori Ishida (tabla) participated and are part of the company. Their activities began with the performance of volunteers at various welfare facilities.     The characteristic of Muyuju, is that the dancers usually sit on chairs while performing the dance, while singing the Sanskrit song or telling the translated story. This style was born from Mayumi Fukushima's physical handicap. They performed at several places, for example, the Embassy of India, Buddhist temples, Fukushima city where the earthquake affected areas, and so on."
